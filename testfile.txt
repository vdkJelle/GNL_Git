Anna, Elsa
It's time to go to bed!
Oh no, he got struck by an evil spell
Quick Elsa, make a prince,
a mighty one
Oh no, the prince is stuck too
Who cares about
danger when there is love
Uh, Anna, blurgh...
Kissing won't save the forest
Who else fairies, cry out!
Is sounds a giraffe maybe? Nevermind
Give way to Fairy Queen
Who breaks the spell and saves everyone
And they all get married!
-What are you playing?
-Enchanted forest
(Anna: The prince and the princess whoosh)
That's like no Enchanted Forest I've ever seen
You've seen the Enchanted Forest?
- Wait, what?
I have, once
And you never told us this before?
Well, I can tell you now
Okay, tell us now
Are you sure about this?
It's time they know
(Whispers: Let's make a big snowman later)
- If they can settle and listen
Far away
As North as we can go
Stood a very old and very Enchanted Forest
But it's magic wasn't that of
goblins spells and horse fairies
It is protected by the most powerful spirit of all
Those're Air, Fire
Water
And Earth
But it was also a home to the
mysterious Northuldra people
Are Northuldra magical, like me?
No Elsa, they were not magical
They just took advantage of the forest gifts
Their ways were so different from ours
But still
They promised us friendship
In honor of that
Your grandfather, King Runeard
Build them a mighty Dam to
strengthen their waters
It was a gift of peace
- That's a big gift of peace
And I was so honored to get to go to the
forest to celebrate it
-Stand tall, Agnarr.
I'm was not all prepared for what the day would bring
We let down our guard
We were charmed
And felt so
Magical
But something went wrong
They were attacking us
It was a brutal battle
Your grandfather ... -Father!
was lost
The fighting enraged the spirits
They turned their magic against us all
There was this... voice
And someone saved me
Untold, the spirit then vanished
And a powerful mist covered the forest
Locking everyone out
And that night, I came home
King of Arendelle
Wow, Papa, that was epic
Whoever saved you
I love them
- I wish I knew who it was
What happened to the spirit?
What is in the forest now?
- I don't know
The mist still stands
No one can get in
And no one has since come out
- So we're safe?
Yes, but the forest could wake again
And we must be prepared on what
ever danger it might bring
And on that note, how about we say
Good Night to your father?
Oh, but I still have so many questions
Save them for another night Anna
Ah, you know I don't have that kind of patience
Why did the Northuldra attack us anyways?
Who attacks people who gave them gifts?
Only Ahtohallan knows.
- Ahtoho-, what?
When I was little
My mother would sing a song about
special river, called Ahtohallan
That was said to hold the answers
about the past
Now what we are part of
Wow, will you sing it for us? Please?
Okay, cuddle close
Scooch in
Where the northwind meets the sea
There is a river full of memory
Sleep, my darling, safe and sound
For in this river all is found
In her waters, deep and true
Lie the answers and path for you
Dive down deep into her sound
But not too far or you'll be drowned
Yes, she will sing to those who hear
And in her song, all magic flows
But can you be brave what you most fear?
Can you face what the river knows?
Where the northwind meets the sea
There's a mother full of memory
Come my darling, homewardbound
When all is lost, then all is found
Your Majesty, -Oh!
They're ready
Hehe, excuse me
I'm coming
Do you hear that?
- What?
Nevermind
Enjoying your new Permafrost, Olaf?
I'm just living the dream Anna
Oh, how I wish this could last forever
- Mmmmm
And yet change mocks us with your beauty
- What's that?
- Forgive me, maturity is making me poetic
Tell me, you are older enough to all-knowing.
Do you ever worry about the notion that
Nothing is permanent
Ahh, no
Really, Wow, I can't wait til I'm age
like you, so I don't have to
worry about important things
That's not what I mean
I dont worry
because ... well I have you
Elsa, Kristoff, Sven and
The gate is open wide and...
And I'm not alone anymore ~
()
Yes, the wind blows a little bit cooler
And we're all getting older
And the clouds are moving on with
every Autumn breeze
Peter Pumpkin just become fertilizer
And my leaf's a little sadder and wiser
That's why I rely on certain certainties
Yes, some things never change
Like the feel of your hand in mine
Some things stay the same
Like how we get along just fine
Like an old stone wall
that'll never fall
Some things are always true
Some things never change
Like how I am holding on tight to you
The leaves are already falling
Sven, it feels like the future is calling
Are you telling me tonight you're
gonna get down on one knee?
Yeah, but I'm really bad at
planning these things out
Like candlelight and pulling of rings out
Maybe you should leave all
the romantic stuff to me
Yeah, some things never change
Like the love I feel for her
Some things stay the same
Like how reindeers are easier.
But if I committ and go for it.
I'll know what to say and do
Right?!
Some things never change
Sven, the pressure is all on you..
The winds are restless~
Could that be why I'm hearing this call?
Is something coming?
I'm not sure I want things
to change at all
These days are precious~
Can't let them slip away
I can't freeze this moment
But I still can go out and seize this day
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
The wind blows a little bit colder
And you all look a little bit older
It's time to count our blessings
beneath an autumn sky
We'll always live in a kingdom of plenty
That stands for the good and the many
And I promise you the flag of Arendelle will always fly
Our flag will always fly!
Our flag will always fly!
Our flag will always fly!
Some things never change
Turn around and time has flown
Some things stay the same
Though the future remains unknown
May our good luck last,
may our past be past
Time's moving fast, it's true
Some things never change
And I'm holding on tight to you
Holding on tight to you
Holding on tight to you
I'm holding on tight to you~
Lion. Grizzly bear
Hunt!
Unreedemable monster!
-Biggest mistake in your life!
who didn't even kissed you
Villain.
-Ooh~
Okay, Olaf, you're up
- Okay
So much easier now that I can read
Lightning round
Boys against girls.
Okay, I'm ready(x2), Go!
Unicorn. Ice cream. Castle.
Oaken. Tea pot. Mouse.
Ooh~, Elsa!
I don't think Olaf should get to rearrange
It doesn't matter this is gonna be a cinch
Two sisters with one mind.
- Thank you.
- Okay, here we go
You got this Elsa, anytime
Just do it with
your body. Nothing. Air
Trees, people, treeple
Oh that's not a word...
shuttle void, teeth?
Oh, doing the dishes
Polar Bear. Hey. Sorry
You gotta give me something
Uhm, Alarmed?, Distracted?
Worried? Panic?
Disturbed, oh, come on. You
definitely looks disturbed, oh
We won. -Rematch?
Oh, you know what, I think i'll turn in.
- Are you OK?
Just.. just tired
Good night
Yeah, I'm tired too, and Sven promised
to read me a bedtime story
Didn't you Sven
- Did I ?
Oh you do the best voices like
when you pretend to be Kristoff and
You're like "I'll just talk to the rock"
But my childhood was disrupted.
- How about you guys start without me?
Does Elsa seem weird to you?
She ... seem like Elsa.
That last word, were they seems
to throw her, what was it?
I do not know, um,
I don't know, but ... - Ah
Ice
Oh come on, she couldn't act that ice?
I better go check on her.
Thanks honey, love you
I love you, too
It's fine
Come in
Yup, something's wrong
- With you? -No, with you
You're wearing mother's scarf
You do that when something's wrong
Huh, did we hurt your feelings?
I'm sorry, if we did. You know, there
are few people that are actually good at
family games, that's just a fact
No that's not it
Then what is it
There this...
I just don't want to mess things up
What this? You're doing great
Oh Elsa, When are you going to see
yourself the way I see you?
What would I do without you?
You'll always have me
I know what you need. Come on
Come here. -What? -It's Mama's words, cuddle close
- Scooch in (??)
- Mhmm
Where the northwind meets the sea
There's a river full of memory
-I know what you are doing
Sleep, my darling, safe and sound
For in this river all is found
I can hear you
But I won't
Some look for trouble, while others don't
There are a thousand reasons I
should go about my day
And ignore your whispers
which i wish would go away (Ohh)
Whoa
You're not a voice
You're just a ringing in my ear
And if I heared you, which i don't
I'm spoken for I fear
Everyone I've ever loved
is here within these walls
I'm sorry, secret sirens, but
I blocking out your call
I've had my adventure, I don't
need something new
I'm afraid of what im risking
if I follow you...
Into the unkown!
Into the unknown!!
Into the unknown!!!~
What do you want? 'Cause
you've been keeping me awake
Are you here to distract
me so I make a big mistake?
Or are you someone out there
who's a little bit like me?
Who knows deep down I'm
not where I meant to be?
Every day's a little harder
as I feel my power grows
Don't you know there's part
of me that longs to go ...
Into the unknown!
Into the unknown!!
Into the unknown!!!~
Are you out there?
Do you know me?
Can you feel me
Can you show me
Where are you going?
Don't leave me alone
How do I follow you?
Into the uknown!!!
Air, fire, water, earth
The water
The air rageous, no fire, no water
The earth is next
We have to get out
It'll be okay, evacuate to the cliffs
Oh no, I'm getting blown
- I got you
Yes, everyone's out and safe
Here, take one of this
You okay there, Olaf?
- Oh Yeah
We're calling this, controlling what
you can when things feel out of control.
Okay, I don't understand
You been hearing a voice
and you didn't think tell me?
I don't want to make you worry
We made a promise not to
shut each other out
Just tell me what's going on
I woke the magical spirit at the Enchanted Forest
Okay, that is definitely not what
what I thought you were gonna say
Wait, the Enchanted Forest?
The one father warned us about?
Yes. Why would you do that?
- Because of the voice
I know it sounds crazy
but I believe whoever is
calling me, is good
How can you say that
Look at our kingdom. -I know, it's
just that may magic can feel it.
I can feel it
Okay
Oh no, what now
The Trolls?
Kristoff, we missed you
Pabbie. -There were never a
dull moment with you two
I hope you're prepared for
what you have done, Elsa
Angry magical spirit are
not for the faint of heart
Why are they still angry? What does
all of this have to do with Arendelle
Let me see what I can see
The past is not what it seems
A round demands to rewrite it
Arendelle is not safe
The truth must be found
Without it
I see no future
No future?
When one can see no future
All one can do is the next right thing
The next right thing?
Is for me to go to the Enchanted
forest and find that voice
Kristoff can I borrow your wagon, and Sven
- I'm not comfortable with the idea of that
- You are not going alone
Anna, No, I have my powers
to protect me, you don't
Excuse me, I climb to the north mountain, survived
a frozen heart, and saved you from my ex-boyfriend
And I did it all without powers,
so you know, I'm coming
Me too, I'll drive
- I'll bring the snacks
I will look after your people
Please make sure they stay away from
kingdom until we return.
Anna, I'm worried for her,
we have always feared
Elsa's power is too much for this world
We must pray they are enough
I will not let anything happen to her
??? , I am, ok
Did you know that water has memory?
True fact, it's disputed by
many, but it's true.
Did you know we are six times more
likely to be struck by lightning?
Did you know Gorillas burp when they're happy?
Did you know we blinked
4 million times a day
Did you know sleeping quietly
on long journey prevents insanity?
Yeah, that's not true. -It is
-It is defenitely true. -It's the truth
Hmm, well that's unanimous
But I look it up
when we get home
They're both asleep
So ... what do you wanna do?
Sven, keep us steady, will you?
Anna. Hm. Anna, remember our
first trip like this when
I said you have to be crazy to want marry
a man you just met. - Wait, what?
Crazy? You didn't say I was
crazy, you think I'm crazy?
No, I did, you were--
not crazy, clearly
Just naive, not naive,
just ah.. just new to love
Like I was, and
When you're new, you are
bound to get it .. wrong.
So you're saying, I'm wrong for you.
What? No, no, I'm not saying you're wrong,
or crazy, I'm sayi-...
- Good idea. - I hear it.
I hear the voice. - You do?
Olaf, wake up
- Whoa
- Wow
Promise me, we do this together, okay?
I promise
It's okay
Did you know that Enchanted Forest
is a place of transformation?
I have no idea what that means
But I can't wait to see what it's
gonna do to each one of us
What is this
What was that?
No, no, no
And we're locked in
I did not see that coming
This forest is beautiful
The Dam .. It still stands
It was in GrandPabbie's visions, but why?
I don't know, but it's still in
Good shape, thank goodness.
Well if that Dam broke, it would
send tidal waves so big, it would
wash away everything on this fjord
Everything? But..
Arendelle is on this fjord
Nothing gonna to happen to Arendelle
Anna, it's gonna be fine
Come here.
You know, under different
circumstances, this would be
a... very romantic place
- Don't you think?
- Different circumstances?
You mean like with someone
else? What? No, no, I'm saying
Hm, just in case we don't
make it out of here.
You don't think we're gonna
make out of here?
No, no, I mean, no, we
will make it out of here
Well, technically the odds are kinda
complicated, but my point is..
In case we die
You think we're gonna die? No! no!
No, we will die at some point
- I swear that I will not leave her side
- Not even any reason time will we die but...
- Elsa?
-Way far in the future, we will die
Don't patronize me
Elsa, there you are
- You okay? - I'm fine. - Okay, good
Where's Olaf?
Umm, Anna?
Elsa?
Samantha?
I don't even know who's Samantha
That's normal
What was that?
Samantha?
This will all sense sense when I am older
Someday I will see that this makes sense
One day, when I'm old and wise
I'll think back and realize
That these were all completely normal events
Ah!
I'll have all the answers when I'm older
Like why we're in this dark enchanted wood
I know in a couple years
these will seem like childish fear
And so I know this isn't bad, it's good
Growing up means adapting
Puzzling out your world and your place
When I'm more mature
I'll fell comfortably secure
Being watched by something
with a creepy, creepy face
See, that will all make sense when I'm older
So no need to be terrified or tense
I'll just dream about a time
When I'm in my aged prime
'Cause when you're older
Absolutely, everything makes sense
This is fine
Hey guys, meet the wind spirit
Coming through
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick
I'll hold your hands, but
I can not find my arms
Hey! Stop
Elsa!
Let her go
Anna, be careful!
- That's my sister
Prince Agnarr
For Arandelle
Are you ok?
- I'm Fine?
They look like moments in time
What's that thing you say Olaf?
Oh, my theory about advanced technology
is both our savior and our doom?
No, not that one, the one
about ... The one about cucumbers ...
The thing about water
Water has memory
The water that makes up you and me
has passed through at least 4 humans
and or animals before us
And remembers everything
You're naughty, I think
I'll name you Gale
Get out there
Oh, hi, are you curious
You are in the better mood now?
Father
It's father
This girl
She's saving him
She's Northuldra
What is that?
Olaf get behind me
- Why are you gonna do with that?
- I have no idea
Lower your weapons
- And you lower yours
- Arandellian Soldiers?
- Threatening my people Lieutenant?
- Invading my Dam space, Yelena?
Why does that soldier looks so familiar?
Lieutenant, get the sword!
That was magic
- Did you see that?
- Of course I saw it
Just an ice cold greeting
- They've been trapped in here this whole time?
- What do we do now?
I got this, hi I'm Olaf
Oh sorry, yeah, I just find
clothes restricting
Bet you're wondering who
we are and why we are here,
It's really quite simple
It began with two sisters
One born with magical power
One born powerless,
their love of snowman?
Anna, No! too high
Ooww, Mama, Papa, Help
Doors shutting everywhere,
Sisters torn apart
Well at least they have their parents
Oh, I am Anna, I marry a man I just met
Elsa gonna blow, snow, snow, ah run!
Magic pulses through my snowflakes
I live, ice palace for one, ice palace for one
- Get out Anna.
- My heart
- Oh my goodness
- Here's the true love's kiss
You're not worth it, get out
I'm the bad guy.
And Anna freezes to death, forever
Then she unfreeze it.. oh and
then Elsa woke up the magical spirit
And we were forced out
from our kingdom,
Now our only hope is
find the truth about the past,
but we don't have a clue
how to do that,
Excepts Elsa hearing voices,
so we got that going for us
Any question?
I think they got it
Are you really queen of Arendelle?
I am. Why would nature rewards
a person of Arendelle with magic?
Perhaps to make up for the
actions of your people
My people are innocent, we
will have never attack first
May the truth be found
- Hi, I'm sor-, uh, what's happening?
- That's it!
Lieutenant Mattias, library,
second port on the left,
You are our father's official guard
What did happened to your parents?
Our parents' ship went down
in the southern sea 6 years ago
I see him
I see him in your faces
- Really?
We maybe getting old in years
But we're still strong
Proud to serve Arendelle
Wait, please
Someone has called me here
If I can just find it
I believe they have the answer
that may help us free this forest
Trust me, I just want to help
We only trust nature
When nature speaks
We listen
This will all makes sense
when I'm older
Fire spirit
Get back everyone! Go to the river!
No, no, no reindeer
that's a dead end
Come on Sven, we'll get them
Elsa, get out of there
Elsa
Come on buddy, we can do this
Anna
- Get her out of here!
- No! Elsa!
They're all looking at us, aren't they?
Got any advice?
Nothing? Hmm
Should I know what that means?
You hear it too
Somebody's calling us, who is it?
What do we do?
Okay, keep going north
Elsa!
Oh thank goodness. Anna. Are you okay?
-What were you doing?
You could have been killed, you
can't just follow me into fire
You don't want me to follow you into
fire, then don't run into fire
You are not being careful Elsa
I'm sorry, are you okay?
I've been better
I know what you need
Where did you get that scarf?
That's a Northuldra's scarf
- What?
- This is from one of our oldest families
It was our mother's
Elsa
I see it, it's mother
Mother saved father's life that day
Our mother was Northuldra
We are the people of the Sun
I promise you
I will free this forest,
and restore Arendelle
That's a pretty big promise Elsa
Free the forest
Wow
Im sorry, I just ... ah
Some of us were born in here, we've never
even seen the clear sky.
- My name is Ryder
- Kristoff
I heard the voice again
We need to go north. -But the earth
giant nows roaming north at night
You can leave in the morning
- I'm Honeymaren.
- Honeymaren, we'll do all we can
Hey, let me ask you,
how do you guys
cope with the ever increasing complexity
of thought that comes with maturity?
Brilliant
It's so refreshing to talk
to the youth of today
Our future is in bright hands
Oh no, no, no..
Don't chew that, you don't
know what I've stepped there
I can't seem to
get her attention
- Or even say the thing
- Well, you're in luck
I know nothing about women
But I do know that we have the
most amazing way of proposing
If we start now, we'll be ready at dawn.
- Really?
It involves a lot of reindeer
Hey, back home, Halimah's
still over on (name??)
She is. -Really?
Is she married? - Mm-mm
- Oh wow, why would that make me feel better?
- What else do you miss?
My father
He passed long before all this
He was a great man
Build us a good life is Arendelle,
but took ..??.. for granted
He'd say, Be prepared!
Just when you think you found your way,
life will throw you on a new path
What do you do when it does?
Don't give up
Take it one step at a time
And
Just do the next right thing
Yeah, you got it
I wanna show you something
May I?
You know, air, fire, water and earth
- Yes.
- But look
There is a fifth spirit
It said to be a bridge between
us and a magical nature
- A fifth spirit?
- Some say...
they hear it call out the
day before the spell
My father heard it,
Do you think that's whats calling me?
Maybe
Alas, only Ahtohallan knows
Ahtohallan
Dive deep into her sound
But not too far away or you'll be drowned
Why do lullabies always have to
have some terrible warning in them?
I wonder that all the time
Earth giants
What are they doing down here?
This is why we
don't play with fire
Ah, I can't stay mad
to you, you're so cute
Please tell me, you are not
about to follow them
What if I can settle them like
I did with the wind and fire
Or what if they can crush you
before you even get the chance
Remember, the goal
is to find the voice,
find the truth and get us home
- Hey guys, that was close
- I know
The giant sensed me
They may come back here, I don't
want to put everyone at risk again
And you're right you're Anna
we've got to find the voice
- We're going now.
- Okay, we're going, let me just ..
Wait, where are Kristoff and Sven?
Oh yeah, I think they took off with
that Ryder guy and a bunch of reindeer
They left?
Just left without saying anything?
Who knows the ways of men.
Am I supposed to feel this ridiculous
Oh yeah, definitely
- Everyone ready?
- Ready. Ah, I could use a rehearsal
- Hey love-love..
- Wait, you talk to them too?
- I do.. -It's like you can
actually hear what they're thinking
Yeah and you.. you just say it
And then you just say it
Okay, here she comes
Princess Anna of Arendelle
My fiesty love, fearless,
ginger sweet love
Will you marry me?
Um, no
The princess left with the queen
What queen? What?
What?!
I wouldn't try to follow,
they're long gone
Long gone?
So yeah
Um, we're heading west, to the Lycan
Meadows, you can come with us if you want
Hey, um
- I'm sorry ...
- No, it's fine..
- Yeah, yup
Hm, okay, I'd better go pack
- You coming with?
- I'll just ah, yah I'll meet you there
Ahh, you know where you're going.
Yah
Yah, I know the woods.
Reindeer are better than people
Sven, why is love so hard?
You feel what you feel
And those feeling is real
Come on, Kristoff. Let down your guard
Again, you're gone
Off on a different path than mine
I'm left behind
Wondering if I should follow
You had to go
And, of course, it's always fine
I probably could catch up
with you tomorrow
But is this what it feels
like to be growing apart
When did I become the one
who's always chasing you heart?
Now I turn and find
I am lost in the woods
North is south, right
is left when you're gone
I'm the one who sees you home
But now I'm lost in the woods
And I do not know
what path you are on
I' m lost in the woods
Up 'til now
The next step was
a question of how
I never thought it was
a question of whether
Who am I, if I'm not your guy?
Where am I, if we're
not together
Now I know you're my true north
'Cause I'm lost in the woods
Up and down, day is night
When you're not there
Oh, you're my only landmark
So I'm lost in the woods
Wondering if you still care
But I'll wait
For a sign
( For a sign )
'Cause you are mine
Until then
I'm lost in the woods
Lost in the woods
( Lost in the woods )
( Lost )
Hey Olaf, umm
Maybe just one of you should do it
I agree, she's a little pitchy
Hey, Gale's back
- How can it be?
- What is it?
Mother and father's ship
But this isn't the southern sea
No, it isn't
Why their ship is here
How're their here
It must have been washed
in from the dark sea
What would it be doing in the dark sea?
I don't know
How did the ship get through the mist?
I thought nobody could but us,
unless...
Nobody was on it
There's gotta be something here
Wait, wait, look around
Every Arandellian ship
has a compartment, waterproof
That's very clever
Although that makes me wonder why they
dont just make the whole ship waterproof
Here!
I don't know, but look,
this is mother's handwriting
The end of the ice age,
the river found but lost
Magic's source
Elsa's sources?
It's a map
They traveled north
Planned to cross the dark sea to..
Ahtohallan
- It's real?
- Ahtoho- what?
It's a magical river said to hold
all the answers about the past
Do you reinforcing my water
has a memory theory?
Water has memory
Elsa?
I wanna know what
happened to them
- Ahtohallan is the source of the magic
- We keep going
But elsa ...
???
Elsa!
Hey hey, what are you doing?
This is my fault, they were
looking for answers about me
You are not responsible
for their choices, Elsa
No, just their deaths
Stop. No
Yelana asks why would the spirit reward
Arendelle with the magical queen?
Because our mother saved our father
She saved her enemy
Her good deeds was rewarded
With you
- You are a gift.
- For what?
If anyone can resolve the past
If anyone can save Arendelle
and free this forest, it's you
I believe in you Elsa
More than anyone or anything
Honeymaren said there was a fifth spirit
A bridge between magical nature and us
- A fifth spirit.
- That what's been calling me
From Ahtohallan
The answers about the past are all there
So we go to Ahtohallan
Not we
Me
The dark sea too dangerous for us both
No, we do this together
Remember the song, go too
far and you'll be drowned
Who will stop you
from going too far?
You said you believed in me,
that this is what I was born to do
And I do not want to
stop you from that
I don't want to stop you from being
whatever you need to be, I just-
don't want you dying
Trying to be everything
for everyone else too
Don't do this alone
Let me help you, please
I can't lose you Elsa
I can't lose you either, Anna
Come on
Wait what? What are you doing? Elsa!
No, no ...
Olaf, help me stop
Give me a hand!
Hang on!
Oh no
Come on!
Anna, this is might
sounds crazy, but I'm
- sensing some rising anger
- Ah, Now I am angry, Olaf
- She promised me we do
this together. - Yeah, but ...
What I mean is I'm sensing
rising anger in me
- Wait, you're angry?
- I think so
Elsa pushed me away too and
Didn't even say goodbye
- And you have every right to
to be very, very mad at her
And you've said some things
never changed, but since then
Everything done's nothing
but change. - I know
But look
I'm still here holding your hand
Yeah, I think that's a good point Anna
I feel better,
you're such a good listener
Shh, shh, shh!
Oh the Giants, they're huge
Hang on Olaf
Try not to scream
Found it
Thank you.
Where are we?
In a pit, with no way out
But with this spooky
pitch black way in
Come on, it'll be fun
Assuming we don't get
stuck here forever
and no one ever find us
You started it and I gave up
But bright side
Elsa gotta be all out
better than we are
Of course
Glaciers are rivers of ice
Ahtohallan is frozen
I hear you, and I'm coming
Every inch of me is trembling
But not from the cold
Something is familiar
Like a dream , I can
reach but not quite hold
I can sense you there
Like friend, I've always known~
I'm arriving
And it feels like I am home
I have always been a fortress
Cold secrets deep inside
You have secrets too
But you don't have to hide
Show yourself
I'm dying to meet you
Show yourself
Are you the I've been looking for
All of my life?
Show yourself
I am ready to learn
Ah ah ah ah
I've never felt so certain
All my life I've been torn
But I'm here for a reason
Could it be the reason I was born?
I have always been so different
Normal rules did not apply
Is this the day?
Are you way
I finally find out why?
Show yourself
I'm no longer trembling
Here I am
I've come so far
You are the answer I've waited for
All of my life
Oh, show yourself
Let me see who you are
Come to me now
Open your door
Don't make me wait
One moment more
Oh, come to me now
Open your door
Don't make me wait
One moment more
I just wasn't looking where I
was going, but I'm great
Actually ... Prince
Hans of the Southern Isle
I love you. I need to
tell you about my past
- And where I'm from?
- I'm listening
Iduna!
- What are you reading, your Majesty?
- Just some outdated author
King Runard, I'm sorry,
I don't understand
We're bringing Arendelle's full guard
But they have given us no
reason not to trust them
The Northuldra follow magic
Which means we can never trust them.
Magic makes people
feel too powerful
Too entitled, it
makes them think
They can defy the
will of a king
That is not what magic does
That's just your fear
Fear is what
can't be trusted
You see, the Dam will weaken their lands,
so they will have to turn to me
for you, dive down deep into her sound
But not too far or you'll be drowned
They will come in celebrations,
and then
We will know their
size and strength
As you have welcomed us
We welcome you
Our neighbors, our friends
King Runeard, the Dam isn't strengthening
our waters, it's hurting the forest
It's cutting off the North...
- Let's not discuss this here
Let's, way at noon, at tea,
find a solution
No!
Which blacky tunnel do we choose?~
You see, the Dam will weaken their lands
So they will have to turn to me
King Runeard, the Dam is hurting the forest!
Elsa's found it
- What is it?
- The truth about the past
That's my grandfather
Attacking the Northuldra leader
Who wields no weapon
The Dam wasn't to gift of peace
It was a trick
But that goes against
everything Arendalle stands for
It does, doesn't it?
I know how to free the forest,
I know what we have to do,
To set things right
Why do you say that so sadly?
We have to break the Dam
But Arendelle will be flooded
That's why everyone was forced out
To protect them from
what has to be done
Oh
Are you okay?
I could really use a bright side, Olaf
The bright side, um
Turtles can breathe through their butts?
And I see a way out
I knew I can count on you
Come on, Olaf
Elsa probably on her way back
right now, we can meet her and-
Olaf?
What's this? - Are you okay?
- I'm flurring?
Wait, no, that's not it
I'm flurring, away...
The magic in me is fading
What?
I don't think Elsa is okay
I think...
She may have gone too far
No, no.
- Anna
I'm sorry
You're gonna have to do
this next part on your own
Okay?
-Wait, come here
I've got you
That's good
Hey Anna
I just thought of one thing that's permanent.
-What's that?
Love
Warm hugs?
I like warm hugs
I love you
Olaf, Elsa
What do I do now?
I've seen dark before
But not like this
This is cold
This is empty
The life that I knew is over
The lights are out
Hello darkness
I'm ready to succumb
I follow you around
I always have
But you've gone to a
place I cannot find
This grief...
has a gravity, it pulls me down
But a tiny voice
whispers in my mind
You are lost
Hope is gone
But you must
Go on
And do the next right thing
Can there be a day
beyond this night?
I don't know anymore what is true
I can't find my direction, I'm all alone
The only star that guided me was you~
How to rise from the floor
When it's not you I'm rising for?
Just do the next right thing
Take a step
It is all that I can, to do..
The next right thing
I won't look too far ahead
It's too much for me to take
But break it down to this next breath
This next step
This next choice
So I'll walk through this night
Stumbling blindly toward the light
And do the next right thing
And with the dawn, what comes then?
When it's clear that everything
will never be the same again?
Then I'll make the choice
To hear that voice
And do...
The next right thing
Wake up!
Wake up!!!
That's it!
Come and catch me! Come on!
Okay, that's it!
Keep coming!
That worked
No, no-no, she's leading
them to the Dam
- Kristoff!
- I'm here
- What do you need?
- To get to the Dam
- Help me up!
- We'll meet you around!
- Lieutenant Mathias
- Your Highness
- What are you doing?
- The Dam must fall
It's the only way to break the
the mist, and free the forest
But we've sworn to protect
Arendelle at all cost
Arendelle has no future
until we make this right
King Runard betrayed everyone
How do you know that?
My sister gave her
life, for the truth
Please
Before we lose anyone else
Destroy the Dam, come on!
Throw your boulders!
That's it
I got her
Hang on
I'm sorry I left you behind
I was just so deperate
to protect her
I know, I know, it's okay
My love is not fragile
Look at the sky
I just didn't realize there so much of it
34 years
5 months
And 23 days
Is it really you?
Anna
- I thought I lost you
- Lost me?
You saved me
Again. I did? And Anna
Arendelle did not fall
It didn't?
The spirits all agree
Arendelle deserves to stand with you
You did what was right,
for everyone
Did you find the fifth spirit?
You are the fifth spirit
- You are the bridge
- Luckily the bridge has two sides
And mother had two daughters
We did this together
And we'll continue
to do this together
Elsa! You're okay!
You look different
Did you cut your hair or something?
Oh
Anna, I need to ask you a question
Okay
Do you wanna build a snowman?
What?
Thank goodness, water has memory
Anna, Elsa
Kristoff and Sven
You all okay god!
I love happy endings
I mean I presume we're done
Or is this putting us in more dangerous
situation gonna be, a regular thing?
No, we're done
- Actually...
There is one more thing, Anna..
You are the most extraordinary
person I've ever known
I love you with all I am
Will you marry me?
Yes!
Arendelle's okay
- What?
Ahtohallan is beautiful
Hello.
- You know
You belong up here
I took an oath to always do
what's best for Arendelle
Luckily,
I know just what that is
I still don't know what
transformation means
I feel like this forest,
has really changed us all
Presenting, our Majesty
Queen Anna of Arendelle
Sven, don't you look nice
Oh my goodness! Olaf
Charmed?, I'm sure
- Charming.
- Your Majesty
Kristoff
Oh, did you boys get dressed up for me?
It was Sven's idea
One hour, you get
this for one hour
That's okay, I prefer
you in leather anyway
I'm shocked you can last
an hour, that was brutal
Hm, the things we do for love
What is this crazy magic called again?
A photograph
- Photograph...
Ah, really good
Halima, General Mathias
Ah Your Majesty. I'll be right back, you
can look at our photograph while I'm gone
I am just kidding,
How do I look? - Fantastic
Our lands and our people
Now connected by love
Hi Gale, you like it?
Oh, do you mind?
I've got a message for my sister
Thank you
Charade's friday night, don't be late
And don't worry,
Arandalle is doing just fine
Keep looking after the forest
I love you
I love you too, Sis
Hi Gale, I'm going for a ride, wanna come?
Are you ready?
